# IT254-GroupProject
Voice activated fan with timer
This project consists of a fan that is controlled by a timer that's set by text-to-speech AI. When you turn on a light (simulated with a button and LED arduino circuit), the AI will ask how long you want the fan on for. It is currently set to recognize the commands for 10 seconds, 30 seconds, and one minute. The fan will turn off when the timer is done or the light is turned off.
